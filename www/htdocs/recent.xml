<p>The <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20080915/clickjacking/">announcement
of the clickjacking research</a> ignited interest in a number of Web exploits,
some of which seem new and others similar to known exploits. Already, there's
lots of
<a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-7">discussion of
possible workarounds</a>, mainly focused on changes to the application's user
interface, or the browser's rendering logic. While the flexibility of the
browser's user interface languages gives clickjacking a polished look, this
flexibility isn't actually what enables these attacks. That blame lies with the
ambient authority model used by most web applications. If applications instead
used an explicit authorization model, they would not be vulnerable to
clickjacking and there would be no need to reduce the flexibility of the
browser's user interface languages. Web applications can be implemented to an
explicit authorization model without any change to Web protocols or
formats.</p>

<p>Any application that keeps state needs a plan for maintaining it as the
application evolves. Successfully managing these upgrades is one of the more
challenging aspects of application development. This document explains several
patterns and techniques for managing upgrade in a Waterken application.</p>

<p>Mashups, web applications that interact with other web applications, are
receiving increasing developer interest and providing users with valuable new
functionality. When one or more of the interacting applications have access
control requirements, many design challenges arise. Failure to meet these
challenges brings unnecessary risk to the user.  Addressing the challenges
using a poorly suited technique can add significant complexity to both the
application code and the user interface, all while not reducing risk to the
user.  In addition to examining and explaining these failings, this paper
introduces a solution, the web-key, an https URL convention for representing a
transferable permission in a web application. Using web-keys, access control
challenges can be effectively solved using existing development tools for web
applications deployed to existing web browsers.</p>
