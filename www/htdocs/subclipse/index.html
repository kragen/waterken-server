 <h1>Using Subversion with the Waterken<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Server under Eclipse</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>This tutorial explains how to build a new Eclipse workspace for the
 Waterken Server with the server code integrated with the Subversion source
 control system.</p>
 <p>The Waterken Server uses the Joe-E verifier to ensure that it uses
 authority in a way that minimizes the risk of breach. This tutorial does not
 include how to install the Joe-E verifier plugin and to use it to examine
 your own code for dangerous uses of authority. It does cover installation of
 the Joe-E files because the Waterken Server uses some Joe-E libraries
 internally.</p>
 <h2>Step by step</h2>
 <h3>Start new workspace for Waterken under Eclipse</h3>
 <p>Start Eclipse. Go to "File/Switch Workspace/Other". You may want to check
 "Copy Settings/WorkBench Layout" if you have a custom layout you like.</p>
 <p>Eclipse will restart with an empty workspace. Click the right-most icon to
 go to the workspace view.</p>
 <h3>Configure proxies</h3>
 <p>If you are working behind a firewall, you may need to configure the proxy
 in Eclipse. In Eclipse 3.2, go to "Window/Preferences/Install_Update" and
 configure the proxy hostname and port. Under Eclipse 3.3, go to
 "Window/Preferences/General/Network Connection".</p>
 <p>Reboot Eclipse if you had to set a proxy.</p>
 <h3>Install Subversion plugin into Eclipse</h3>
 <p>The Subclipse development team has an excellent
 <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html">step by step description</a>
 of installing their plugin at their site.</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Click "Help/software Updates/Find and Install.../Search" for new features
      to install. Click "Next".</li>
  <li>Click "New Remote Site". In the dialog, use name "Subclipse", URL
      <code>&lt;http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Select the Subclipse plugin and its subcomponents (you do not need the
      Integrations subcomponent).</li>
  <li>Click ok to the rest of the stuff: the license agreement, the "Finish",
      the "Go Ahead Even though Nobody Put a Silly Signature on the Code"
      button.</li>
  <li>Reboot Eclipse.</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Yet another proxy setting</h3>
 <p>Subversion has its own place to look for proxy settings. Now that you have
 installed the plugin, the subversion software itself has been automagically
 installed. It needs its proxy settings configured as well. Find the "servers"
 file, in Windows it can be found in your Application Data folder under
 Subversion. In Linux, it can be found in <code>~/.subversion</code>.</p>
 <p>In the servers file, go to the <code>[global]</code> section. Find the two
 lines (they show up in other sections as well, do not set the wrong
 ones!),</p>
<pre>
# http-proxy-host = proxy2.some-domain-name.com
# http-proxy-port = 9000
</pre>
 <p>Remove the # at the beginning of the line, and put in the proxy info.</p>
 <h3>Enter the Waterken repository</h3>	
 <ol>
  <li>Go to "Window/Open Perspective/ Other/ SVN Repository"</li>
  <li>Right-click in the "SVN Repos" tab, click "New", enter the Waterken
      Server repository:
      <code>&lt;https://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/waterken/server/trunk/waterken&gt;</code>.
      Click "Next".</li>
  <li>Disregard the certificate warning, (i.e., click "ok, accept permanently").</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Build the development environment</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>In the Subversion tab you should now have the waterken repository
  listed. This brings you to all the individual project folders.</li>
  <li>For each folder, right-click and choose "Checkout.../Checkout as a
  project in the Workspace/Finish". Check them out in the following order (the
  order is not important unless you try to do test-compiles during the
  checkout process, the order is the order of compiler dependencies):</li>
  <ol>
   <li>joe-e</li>
   <li>ref_send</li>
   <li>example</li>
   <li>persistence</li>
   <li>network</li>
   <li>web_send</li>
   <li>remote</li>
   <li>dns</li>
   <li>server</li>
  </ol>
  <li>At this point, you should have all the sources for the Waterken Server
      installed.  Switch from the Repository view to the Java view, and run
      "Project/Clean..." to ensure it all builds.</li>
  <li>Go back into the Subversion view and checkout the www folder 
      <i>just underneath the web_send folder</i>.  This is not a source
      folder, so you get additional dialogs. Simply choose "Checkout as a
      Project in the Workspace". Click "Finish".</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Updating from the repository</h3>
 <p>To update, in the Java view, select the folders you want to sync/update,
 right-click, choose "Team/Update". This makes all the setup effort worth it,
 right?</p>
 <h3>Running the Waterken Server </h3>
 <p>To run the server under Eclipse, you need to configure the Run or Debug
 window.  Click "Debug/Open Debug Window... Debug as a Java Application",
 "Name" is "serve", "Main Project" is "server", "Main Class" is
 "org.waterken.server.Serve". Go to the "Arguments" tab, set "Working
 Directory" to "Other", click "Variables", choose "workspace_loc".  Press
 "Debug". You should see server messages appearing in the Console. Open a
 browser on <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> to see
 the welcome message from the server.</p>
 <p>Congratulations! You are now on your own.</p>
