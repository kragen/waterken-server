<h1><a name="title" href="#title">The Confused Deputy rides again!</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20080915/clickjacking/">announcement
of the clickjacking research</a> ignited interest in a number of Web exploits,
some of which seem new and others similar to known exploits. Already, there's
lots of
<a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-7">discussion of
possible workarounds</a>, mainly focused on changes to the application's user
interface, or the browser's rendering logic. While the flexibility of the
browser's user interface languages gives clickjacking a polished look, this
flexibility isn't actually what enables these attacks. That blame lies with the
ambient authority model used by most web applications. If applications instead
used an explicit authorization model, they would not be vulnerable to
clickjacking and there would be no need to reduce the flexibility of the
browser's user interface languages. Web applications can be implemented to an
explicit authorization model without any change to Web protocols or
formats.</p>
<h2><a name="clickjacking" href="#clickjacking">Clickjacking</a></h2>
<p>As a Web user, you may have the ability to initiate privileged actions that
others cannot. For example, you can delete all the email from your web-mail
account, or liquidate your stock portfolio, or start recording video from your
webcam. Normally, you initiate these actions by clicking on buttons in web
pages. A clickjacking attack can be used to direct seemingly benign mouse
clicks to these privileged buttons.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxyLbpldmuU">For example, you may think
you're playing a game, when you're actually starting a webcam recording</a>.
Using only CSS and HTML, an attacker can create a transparent IFRAME of a
victim web page that contains privileged buttons. Below this transparent
IFRAME, the attacker puts content, like a game, that entices the user to click.
Although the user only sees the game, the mouse clicks are delivered to the
transparent buttons, since they are on top of the game.</p>
<h2><a name="reaction" href="#reaction">The reaction</a></h2>
<p>Specific information about the clickjacking research is still
<a href="http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20081007/clickjacking-details/">coming
out</a>, but it looks like the researchers have found a number of compelling
ways to entice users to click on privileged buttons without realizing it. So far,
<a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-7">initial
proposals</a> to fix these problems seem directly inspired by the details of
these exploits; either banning the particular techniques used; or sending the
victim server metadata about the particular interaction, so that it can choose
to reject the request.</p>
<p>The particular rendering techniques highlighted by the clickjacking
research are fascinating, but this glitz may distract from the actual
underlying problem. Much simpler techniques could also be used in a plausible
clickjacking attack, and so perhaps make the actual problem more apparent.  For
example, consider a scenario where a single button press can launch a dangerous
action. The attacker could engage the user in a game of mouse clicking, and
then, just as the user was about to click, navigate the browser to the page
containing the privileged button. In this case, there are no IFRAMEs or
transparency settings, just a simple page navigation. If the solution to this
problem is restricting the features of the Web's user interface languages, then
much of the Web sits on the chopping block. Perhaps there's another, better,
way to look at this problem.</p>
<h2><a name="ambient" href="#ambient">Ambient authority</a></h2>
<p>The buttons that the clickjacker directs clicks to are privileged buttons
that require the user's authority to work. Typically, this authority is
expressed in the form of cookies, derived from the user's password . Whenever
the browser sends off an HTTP request, it includes all the corresponding
cookies for the request target. This model for using authority is called
<i>ambient</i> because requests don't explicitly specify what authority should
be used. Instead, the execution environment automatically adds all possibly
relevant authority to every request. From the programmer's perspective, things
automatically provided by the execution environment, like CPU time and memory,
seem to be part of the ambient environment in which they work, never explicitly
mentioned, but there when you want them.</p>
<h2><a name="confused-deputy" href="#confused-deputy">Confused Deputy</a></h2>
<p>Over 20 years ago, Norm Hardy noticed that treating authority as part of the
ambient environment of a program creates problems when that program is running
on behalf of distinct parties. To illustrate the problem, Norm wrote a paper,
<a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/ConfusedDeputy.html">The Confused
Deputy</a>, about a compiler that keeps a usage log for billing purposes. This
compiler runs on behalf of the user, accessing user source code files and
output files; but also on behalf of the compiler writer, accessing the usage
log. When the compiler is running, it has access to both the user's authority
and the compiler author's authority, but no way to specify when it's using
which. So for example, a tricky user could specify the name of the usage log as
the output file for compilation, thus overwriting all the billing
information.</p>
<p>Today's web browsers are much like the compiler in the Confused Deputy
paper. The browser runs on behalf of the user, using the user's passwords; but
also on behalf of web sites, rendering their web pages. Like in the compiler
example, there's no way to specify whether a particular request is being done
at the user's direction, or solely on the instructions of a visited web page.
Once again, a tricky web site can exploit this ambiguity by specifying the name
of a victim web page in an IFRAME request, thus puting a dangerous button in an
unexpected place.</p>
<p>When viewed from an access-control perspective, clickjacking is another
formulation of a Confused Deputy attack, similar to Cross-Site-Request-Forgery
(CSRF). Typically, a CSRF attack is considered to be one in which the attacker
sends a POST request to a victim site, under the user's authority. Clickjacking
can similarly be thought of as an attack in which the attacker sends a GET
request to a victim site, under the user's authority. In a CSRF attack, the
payoff to the attacker comes from the side-effects of the POST request. In a
clickjacking attack, the payoff comes from the on-screen positioning of private
information.</p>
<h2><a name="explicit" href="#explicit">Explicit authority</a></h2>
<p>The most popular counter-measure for CSRF is to embed an unguessable secret
in the legitimate HTML FORM element. Since the attacker doesn't know the
secret, he is unable to create a FORM that generates a POST request the server
will accept. This use of an unguessable secret for access-control shifts the
web-application from an ambient authority model to an explicit one. The
unguessable secret embodies the authority to perform the request and it must be
explicitly included in the request. A similar technique can be used to protect
against clickjacking.</p>
<p>If the URL for a page containing privileged buttons included an unguessable
secret, the attacker would be unable to create an IFRAME element that refers to
the page. Similarly, the attacker would also be unable to navigate the web
browser to that page at an unexpected moment. By taking away the attacker's
authority to display the privileged buttons, we take away the opportunity to
play tricks with the timing and positioning of their display.</p>
<h2><a name="saving-features" href="#saving-features">Saving the Web</a></h2>
<p>In an explicit authority model, the rendering tricks used in the
clickjacking attacks are not dangerous and so need not be restricted. For
example, there's no need to place restrictions on the use of IFRAMEs or opacity
styling. If an attacker doesn't know the unguessable URL for a victim web page,
he is unable to load the page and so is unable to trick the user into
interacting with the page. If a legitimate site does know the unguessable URL
for a page at a partner site, it can load the page and customize its
presentation. Such customization isn't trickery, since there's no need for
trickery. The legitimate site can already send any request it likes using the
unguessable URL; interaction from the user isn't needed.</p>
<p>Providing comprehensive protection against clickjacking attacks by
restricting the features of the Web's GUI languages would severely handicap the
Web. Even basic functionality such as linking would be negatively affected. A
much better solution is to continue the progression towards explicit
authorization models that began with defense against CSRF.</p>
<h2><a name="web-key" href="#web-key">Web-key</a></h2>
<p>A surprising number of the security problems with today's Web are directly
attributable to the use of ambient authorization. The
<a href="../web-key/">web-key</a> paper explains many of these problems and
also describes how best to use unguessable URLs to address these problems. If
you're starting a new web-application, or trying to fix an existing one, take a
look at web-keys as way to implement a comprehensive solution to these
problems. If you're a browser implementer or standards author consider how best
to support web-keys, before considering how to handicap the Web's GUI
languages.</p>
