<h1>Web-key: Mashing with Permission</h1>
<h2><a name="abstract" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>Mashups, web applications that interact with other web applications, are
receiving increasing developer interest and providing users with valuable new
functionality. When one or more of the interacting applications have access
control requirements, many design challenges arise. Failure to meet these
challenges brings unnecessary risk to the user.  Addressing the challenges
using a poorly suited technique can add significant complexity to both the
application code and the user interface, all while not reducing risk to the
user.  This paper introduces the web-key, an https URL convention for
representing a transferable permission in a web application. Using web-keys,
access control challenges can be effectively solved using existing development
tools for web applications deployed to existing web browsers.</p>
<h2><a name="introduction" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient
scalability, efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable
information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages,
cultures, and media<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>; but not access control
boundaries.  Core to these simple technologies is the URI, which is used for
both identification and interaction: a document can link to a discussed
resource using a URI and a web agent can interact with a resource by directing
a request using a URI. As elucidated in the W3C's Architecture of the World
Wide Web, Volume One [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>], the URI provides a
powerful architectural base upon which to build an information space. This
information space includes the wikis, blogs, search engines, e-commerce sites
and web-applications that so permeate our daily lives. So long as there are no
permissions required, an interaction across this information space is
successfully enabled through the use of URIs. The proliferation of mashups
which integrate information from publicly accessible sites like Google Maps and
Craigslist is testament to the flexibility and utility of the Web's
architecture. However, by convention, and official decrees, a URI is not
typically used to transfer permission in a Web interaction. Consequently, a
mashup developer seeking to integrate data from a non-public source, such as a
user's web-mail account, must augment the architectural base provided by the
URI with some other mechanism for handling permissions. These architectural
additions have not exhibited the same scalability and utility properties, as
evidenced by the dearth of mashups involving non-public information. Typically,
non-public information is made available to a web agent within a walled garden
protected by a username/password. Within this walled garden, Web interactions
take place as before, but are accompanied by proof of knowledge of the
username/password. To interact with a resource in the walled garden, a web
agent must possess this proof. Consequently, a mashup application targeted at
resources in this walled garden typically must be given the corresponding
username/password. This condition holds even if the mashup application only
needs access to a small subset of the resources in the walled garden. For
example, the web-mail mashup may only need read permission on a particular
email folder and not permission to send email as the user. Unfortunately, this
user password model does not enable expression of such a restriction.</p>
<p>In addition to discouraging and complicating Web interactions, augmenting
the architectural base provided by the URI with user passwords does not provide
the protection commonly claimed and expected. Under some circumstances, user
passwords may help a server protect itself from a malicious client, but this
mechanism alone does not help a client protect its server-side resources from
other clients. So the discussed web-mail application may be able to prevent an
interaction from a non-user by requiring a password, but this requirement does
not help a legitimate user protect his permission to use the web-mail
application from other users. Using a technique popularized under the name
Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF), an attacker can abuse a legitimate user's
permission, and so use server-side resources according to his wishes and the
victim's responsibility. Passwords also bring multiple usability problems,
notably a user interaction highly susceptible to phishing.</p>
<p>This paper discusses the problems with current approaches to access control
on the Web and presents the web-key, an https URL<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>
convention for implementing transferable permission on the Web. This convention
enables solution of access control challenges within the architectural model
provided by the URI, thus enabling non-public resources to also benefit from
the advantages coming from the principles identified by the W3C in
[<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>].  This compatibility also means that the
web-key technique can be applied using existing web development tools to create
web applications deployed to existing web browsers.</p>
<p>The web-key technique has been implemented in the Waterken Server
[<a href="#waterken">waterken</a>], an Open Source web application server. Web
applications developed on this server have been successfully tested in many
mainstream web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and
Opera. Many applications have been created on this platform, including an
access controlled wiki, a toy stock market and a two man year personal
collaboration project currently underway at HP Labs.</p>
<p>
Section 2 of this paper examines the difficulties created by the walled garden
approach to access control currently popular on the Web. Section 3 explains the
implementation of a web-key, the proposed alternate approach to access control.
Section 4 shows how the web-key proposal addresses the previously discussed
problems with access control on the Web. Section 5 addresses previously raised
concerns with pursuing an approach like the web-key.</p>
<h2><a name="walled_garden" href="#walled_garden">The walled garden</a></h2>
<p>The most popular mechanism for implementing access control over private
resources on the Web, and the one recommended by the W3C
[<a href="#deep_linking">deep linking</a>], is the username/password. This
section examines the impact of this technology on the Web.</p>
<h3><a name="acl_webarch" href="#acl_webarch">Broken web architecture</a></h3>
<p>The importance of the URI to Web architecture is most clearly expressed by
the following quote from [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
"One goal of the Web, since its inception, has been to build a global community
in which any party can share information with any other party. To achieve this
goal, the Web makes use of a single global identification system: the URI. URIs
are a cornerstone of Web architecture, providing identification that is common
across the Web."
</blockquote>
<p>This identification is only common across the Web for things that have been
assigned a URI. Most often, permission to access a private resource is not
assigned a URI; instead, a URI plus a separate username/password is used.
Augmenting the identification system in this way undermines core architectural
principles of the Web.</p>
<h4><a name="lost_guid" href="#lost_guid">Loss of global identification</a></h4>
<p>Quoting again from [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
"It is a strength of Web Architecture that links can be made and shared; a user
who has found an interesting part of the Web can share this experience just by
republishing a URI."
</blockquote>
<p>When access to a resource is protected by a username/password, even the most
basic operation of dereferencing the URI requires presentation of these
additional identifiers. Consequently, a user cannot share access with another
just by passing a URI. For example, a user of the described web-mail
application may have access to a resource which stores the current contact
information of a friend. Rather than maintain this state on behalf of the
friend, the user may wish to directly delegate access to the contact resource
to the friend, so that it may be updated directly when contact information
changes. If the web-application is protected by a username/password, the user
cannot share access to the contact resource simply by sending their friend the
URI. Instead, sharing access to the contact resource may require sharing full
control over the web-mail account by giving the user's username/password to the
friend. Alternatively, the web-application may support some process whereby the
friend may be given their own username/password, and an access control list
updated by the user to give the friend access to the contact resource. Some may
think this latter scenario plausible, others not, but it is certainly different
from the interaction for sharing access to a publicly accessible resource and
so cannot be assumed to have the same architectural properties. If the single
global identification system provided by the URI is as crucial as the W3C
states, then the publicly accessible Web would never have been built under the
regime currently in place for private resources. The dearth of mashups
involving private resources may be seen as evidence for this position.</p>
<h4><a name="lost_orthogonality" href="#lost_orthogonality">Loss of orthogonality</a></h4>
<p>Since the URI alone is insufficient to direct a web agent to a private
resource protected by a username/password, the additional identifiers must be
transmitted somehow. The only other option in web architecture is the
representation, so the data format for the representation must be designed to
accommodate these additional identifiers. This additional responsibility breaks
the Web's orthogonality principle [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
"Identification, interaction, and representation are orthogonal concepts,
meaning that technologies used for identification, interaction, and
representation may evolve independently."
</blockquote>
<p>To accommodate private resource access, each representation format would
have to provide its own conventions for encoding access permission and evolve
in lockstep with this identification technology. The task of representing a
link is no longer fully delegated to the URI. The alternative to this
requirement is loss of global scope, which occurs when only part of the access
identifier is represented.</p>
<h4><a name="lost_scope" href="#lost_scope">Loss of global scope</a></h4>
<p>Loss of orthogonality is awkward and so many data formats, such as HTML,
don't augment their hyperlink encoding with user credential information and
instead assume this information is held in the ambient environment provided by
the user agent. For each web interaction, the user agent automatically augments
the request with the user's credentials. But this practice is not always safe.
For example, left unrestricted, this practice would allow a visited web page to
read and modify any resource the user can access. If the source hyperlink for
an interaction included the credentials to be used, these could be safely
included in the outgoing request. However, since the data format does not
support encoding of this information, and the ambient credential information
cannot be safely used, the communication must be
banned<sup><a href="f3">3</a></sup>. This communication ban is known as the
Same Origin Policy: a visited web page can only read representations produced
by the web page's own host. This policy stands in stark contrast to the stated
goal of enabling a "global community in which any party can share information
with any other party". Within the web browser, this sharing is prohibited, as a
consequence of failing to implement global identification for private resource
access; a visited web page is unable to specify its permission to access a
private resource.</p>
<h3><a name="acl_usability" href="#acl_usability">Poor usability</a></h3>
<p>In theory, a user's password protects their private resources in a web
application from abuse by other web applications. In practice, there is no such
barrier. Remembering an unguessable password is a difficult burden for a human.
Remembering dozens of them is simply not feasible. To cope with the burden that
has been foisted upon them, many users reuse passwords across multiple web
applications [<a href="#password_habits">password habits</a>]. In this case,
there is no protection barrier between web applications: each has complete
access to the other. This reality is not a failing of the user, but of the user
interaction design, which is predicated upon the user doing the
impractical.</p>
<h3><a name="acl_phishing" href="#acl_phishing">Phishing</a></h3>
<p>In addition to remembering an unguessable password, the user is also asked
to determine the source of a presented login prompt and only reveal the
password if the source can be authenticated as being the intended recipient. In
user testing, this burden has proven to be too great
[<a href="#why_phishing_works">why phishing works</a>]
[<a href="#wsc-usecases">wsc-usecases</a>]. Part of the problem arises from the
similarity between a legitimate interaction and an attack. Consider the
following interaction, presented by the W3C as a textbook case for use of
access control on the Web [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
"Nadia sends to Dirk the URI of the current article she is reading. With his
browser, Dirk follows the hypertext link and is asked to enter his subscriber
username and password. Since Dirk is also a subscriber to services provided by
'weather.example.com,' he can access the same information as Nadia."
</blockquote>
<p>From Dirk's perspective, the above scenario is also a textbook case for
phishing in the case where Nadia is the phisher and the URI sent to Dirk refers
to the phishing site created by Nadia.</p>
<h3><a name="acl_xsrf" href="#acl_xsrf">Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF)</a></h3>
<p>Unless a web application has taken additional precautions, stealing the
user's password using a phishing attack is unnecessary since the user's web
browser will readily employ the user's credentials under the attacker's
directions.</p>
<p>For example, the discussed web-mail application may have a feature to setup
a forwarding address. When in use, this feature automatically forwards a copy
of incoming email to a specified email address, in addition to keeping a copy
for use within the web-mail application. The resource to setup this feature may
be located at a URL like:
<code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/forward&gt;</code>.  A POST request
sent to this resource provides the forwarded to email address and starts email
forwarding. Normally, the user activates this feature from an HTML page served
by the web-mail application, but this need not be the case. In an attack
scenario, another web site could serve an HTML page that contains an identical
form, pre-populated with the attacker's email address. Using Javascript, this
form can be automatically submitted on page load. Assuming the user has already
logged into the web-mail application in the current browsing session, the
user's browser will send the POST request to the web-mail application and
include any cookies, or HTTP authentication credentials, setup with the
web-mail application. The web-mail application receives a POST request
containing exactly the same Request-URI, entity body and cookies as in the
normal case. The user may see nothing out of the ordinary in the web browser's
presentation. Though not directly possessing the user's credentials, the
attacker can nonetheless use them as desired. The walls of this walled garden
only keep out the well intentioned, not intruders.</p>
<p>The attack described above is not enabled by a peculiarity of the Web, but
rather is endemic to applications that treat client authentication as an access
control mechanism<sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>. <em>Client authentication only
establishes that a particular request was sent by a particular client; it does
not establish which of the client's permissions the client intends to exercise
with the request.</em> The latter is required to effectively implement access
control<sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>.  When a request is produced by the
client without communication with others, it may be the case that the server
can assume that the client permissions to be exercised are the ones that must
be exercised in order to service the request.  However, this unstated
assumption is readily violated when a client communicates with other parties.
In the described attack, the client request was produced in collaboration with
the attacker and so included a private resource identifier specified by the
attacker: <code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/forward&gt;</code>.  The
server's assumption that the client intended to apply its email forwarding
permission to the current request was therefore invalid, thus enabling the
attack. The user only intended to view a web page, not apply any permission to
any request generated by the page.</p>
<p>This attack can be defended against by eliminating the assumption about
which of the client's permissions should be exercised by a request, instead
making this selection explicit and unforgeable. A popular way to express this
intent involves reifying the permission as an unguessable secret [<a
href="#XSRF">XSRF</a>]. For example, when browsing the
<code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/forward&gt;</code> resource, the
HTML form in the returned web page includes a hidden field containing a
randomly generated secret. When the form is submitted, the resource checks that
the received request includes the expected secret; if so, the request is
processed and not otherwise. The Same Origin Policy prevents the attacker from
reading a secret produced by the web-mail application and so the attacker is
unable to generate an HTML form that includes a valid secret for the email
forwarding resource.</p>
<p>The above defense protects a POST request from abuse by an attacker, but
does not protect a GET request. For example, consider a user with access to a
confidential report on company finances at:
<code>&lt;https://portal.example.com/audit/summary.html&gt;</code>. An attacker
could direct the user to a blog post which claimed knowledge of the report.
Since the URL for the report summary is guessable, the attacker can guess it
and reference it from an IFRAME in the blog post. This IFRAME may have no
visible border, and so to the user, the blog post appears to contain a copy of
the report summary.  When rendering the IFRAME, the user's browser submits a
GET request for the report to the portal along with any cookies setup for the
user.  The blog post asks: "Do you wish to make any statements before I go
public with this information?" It appears the blogger already has access to the
confidential report, and so the victim may engage in a conversation that
reveals the confidential information. As in the previous example, the user only
intended to view a web page, not enable inclusion of confidential information
in the web page's presentation.</p>
<p>The discussed defense for the POST request can be extended to also cover GET
requests, and other HTTP methods, by putting the explicit permission secret in
the URL for the identified resource. In addition to protecting against XSRF,
this approach also enables a solution to the architectural and usability
problems created by passwords. The detailed design is explained in the
following section.</p>
<h2><a name="implementation" href="#implementation">Web-key implementation</a></h2>
<p>This section presents the web-key https URL convention for representing
transferable permission and describes the resulting web browser interactions.</p>
<h3><a name="what" href="#what">How to represent permission?</a></h3>
<p>According to RFC 3986 [<a href="#URI">URI</a>], one of the main design
considerations for the URI is transmission between users via transcription.
Preserving this feature in a URI that conveys permission creates a number of
design constraints.  Transcription is an offline process, meaning that
delegation of permission from one user to another must also be an offline
process. The act of transcription must also be sufficient to complete the
delegation, as no other data is exchanged. Transcription can be a manual task
for the user, such as when using pencil and paper, so the URI should be kept
short.</p>
<p>These design constraints can be met by binding each permission issued from
the web application to a randomly generated bit string, of sufficient length to
frustrate a brute force online search. An encoded representation of the bit
string is included in the https URL for the permission. An attacker is limited
to an online search, since only the web application can determine whether or
not a particular bit string corresponds to an issued permission, or is just
random garbage.</p>
<p>For many applications, a bit string of length 64 provides sufficient
protection against brute force search. Assuming the web application issues
fewer than a million unique permissions and has a maximum throughput of one
HTTP request per millisecond, an attacker would have to saturate the web
application for 292 years before having even a 50% chance of guessing even a
single valid bit string. When base32 encoded, a bit string of length 64 is 13
characters long. For example, such a character string looks like:
<kbd>"mhbqcmmva5ja3"</kbd>.</p>
<h3><a name="where" href="#where">Where does the key go?</a></h3>
<p>An https URL consists of multiple components, each of which could
conceivably house the key; however, details of the HTTP protocol
[<a href="#HTTP">HTTP</a>] eliminate almost all the available options.</p>
<p>HTTP defines an optional Referer header which is enthusiastically
implemented by web browsers. When following a hyperlink, the Referer header is
automatically generated by the browser and specifies the URL of the page
containing the hyperlink<sup><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>.  To see why this
feature is potentially a problem when using a permission bearing URL, consider
the following example. A user dereferences a URL which provides access to an
email in their web-mail application. The identified email contains a link to a
web page discussed in the email. The user clicks on the hyperlink, whereupon
the browser sends a GET request to the identified server with a Referer header
specifying the URL for the email. The operator of the server referred to by the
hyperlink now has the URL for the email and so can fetch the contents of the
possibly private email.  A more Web 2.0 style web-mail application might have
only a single top level web page from which all interactions take place. In
this case, the permission bearing URL leaked via the Referer header would
provide access to the user's entire email account.</p>
</p>This leakage of a permission bearing URL via the Referer header is only a
problem in practice if the target host of a hyperlink is different from the
source host, and so potentially malicious. RFC 2616 foresaw the danger of such
leakage of information and so provided security guidance in section 15.1.3:</p>
<blockquote>
"Because the source of a link might be private information or might reveal an
otherwise private information source, &hellip; Clients SHOULD NOT include a
Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was
transferred with a secure protocol."
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, clients have implemented this guidance to the letter, meaning
the Referer header is sent if both the referring page and the destination page
use HTTPS, but are served by different hosts.</p>
<p>This enthusiastic use of the Referer header would present a significant
barrier to implementation of the web-key concept were it not for one unrelated,
but rather fortunate, requirement placed on use of the Referer header. Section
14.36 of RFC 2616, which governs use of the Referer header, states that: "The
URI MUST NOT include a fragment." Testing of deployed web browsers has shown
this requirement is commonly implemented.</p>
<p>Putting the unguessable permission key in the fragment segment produces an
https URL that looks like:
<code>&lt;https://www.example.com/app/#mhbqcmmva5ja3&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="browser_how" href="#browser_how">Fetching a representation</a></h3>
<p>Placing the key in the URL fragment component prevents leakage via the
Referer header but also complicates the dereference operation, since the
fragment is also not sent in the Request-URI of an HTTP request. This
complication is overcome using the two cornerstones of Web 2.0: JavaScript and
XMLHttpRequest.</p>
<p>For some set of resources, all issued web-keys use the same path and differ
only in the fragment. The representation served for the corresponding
Request-URI is a skeleton HTML page specifying an onload event handler. When
invoked, the onload handler extracts the key from the document.location
provided by the DOM API. The handler then constructs a new https URL that
includes the key as a query string argument. This new URL is made the target of
a GET request sent using the XMLHttpRequest API. The response to this request
is a representation of the referenced resource. The onload handler uses this
representation to dynamically update the skeleton HTML page to depict the
representation information. The complete interaction is depicted in Figure
1.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="initialGET.gif"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 1: On the initial visit to the web application two HTTP requests
are needed to fetch a representation. The first request fetches a skeleton page
which can be cached forever. The second HTTP request, initiated using
XMLHttpRequest, fetches the resource representation to be dynamically added to
the skeleton page.</p>
</div>
<p>Since the skeleton HTML page is the same for every web-key, the HTTP server
can mark it as cacheable. Consequently, the initial GET is only sent to the
server on the very first visit to the web application. On subsequent web-key
dereference operations, only the GET generated via XMLHttpRequest is sent. This
optimized interaction is depicted in Figure 2.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="subsequentGET.gif"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 2: On a subsequent visit to the web application only
a single HTTP request is needed to fetch a representation, the same number as
for a traditional web page.</p>
</div>
<p>In the GET request that fetches the actual resource representation, the key
is placed in the query, as opposed to the path, to protect it from a security
feature of modern browsers. Many modern browsers include an option to report
each visited URL to a central phishing detection service. The IE7
implementation of this feature first truncates the URL to omit the query
string. The IEblog indicates this approach was taken to protect user privacy
and security [<a href="#phishing_filter">phishing filter</a>]. Unfortunately,
this precaution is not taken in other browsers. Users of these other browsers
who enable online phishing detection must trust that confidentiality is
adequately maintained by the remote service.  Automatically extracting data
from an end-to-end encrypted communications channel and transmitting it to a
third party defeats the intent of the encryption. Hopefully this iatrogenic
security flaw<sup><a href="#f7">7</a></sup> can be fixed in future releases of
these other browsers.</p>
<h3><a name="script_how" href="#script_how">Subsequent requests</a></h3>
<p>After the initial representation fetch completes, the initialized skeleton
page may make subsequent requests using web-keys contained in the resource
representation. For these requests, the URL transformation done by the onload
handler is done right away by the caller and the request sent out using the
XMLHttpRequest API.</p>
<h2><a name="open_safe" href="#open_safe">Deep linking in a free world</a></h2>
<p>This section shows how the web-key proposal addresses the previously
discussed problems with access control on the Web, supports safe cooperation
between web-applications and enables a Web free from the restraints of the Same
Origin Policy.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_webarch" href="#cap_webarch">Good web architecture</a></h3>
<p>By providing a convention for representing a permission as a URL, the
web-key brings permissions into the architectural model created by the URI.
Using the web-key convention, a URL provides global identification for private
resource access. Consequently, no remaining responsibilities are left to the
representation data format. Orthogonality between resource identification and
representation is restored. Restoration of orthogonality means the web-key can
be used with existing representation formats, such as HTML. Since a web-key
carries all the permission identification needed to make a request, such
requests need not be augmented with user credentials taken from the ambient
environment of the user agent. Consequently, global scope is restored.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_usability" href="#cap_usability">Simpler interaction</a></h3>
<p>A web-application using web-keys in effect generates passwords on behalf of
the user and provides them in a form that can be managed using existing user
agent features, such as bookmarks. Each generated password is much stronger
than anything a user could be expected to generate and is unique to the
corresponding permission, instead of being shared across multiple
web-applications, each of which encompasses multiple permissions. A typical
application may have a single top-level resource, whose web-key is bookmarked
by the user. Other resources are then accessed by traversing the hypermedia web
rooted at the top-level resource. From the user's perspective, it's all just
clicking on hyperlinks, a few of which are bookmarks. The user is never
required to generate, nor remember, any secrets. The login prompt can be a
thing of the past.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_phishing" href="#cap_phishing">Phishing resistant</a></h3>
<p>When a user clicks on a web-key, the web user agent uses the hostname
provided by the authority component of the https URL to authenticate the remote
party. Only if this authentication attempt succeeds is the GET request carrying
the permission key sent to the remote party. This entire interaction is
automatically handled by the user agent software, without requiring user
intervention. Essentially, a web-key binds a shared secret to the
authentication credentials for the party the secret is shared with.</p>
<p>This interaction for exchange of a shared secret is much different than that
for a username/password. In a traditional login scenario, it is the user's
responsibility to determine whether or not the login form was securely
presented by the party the password is shared with. A phishing attack preys
upon the user's difficulty fulfilling this responsibility. By eliminating this
user task, a web-key eliminates one vector for phishing.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_xsrf" href="#cap_xsrf">Solves XSRF</a></h3>
<p>An XSRF attack depends upon the attacker's ability to specify an HTTP
request that the attacker is unable to directly produce, but that the victim
can. When permission to access a resource is reified as a web-key, the attacker
is unable to specify an HTTP request that uses that permission. For example, in
the previously discussed XSRF attack, the abused permission was identified by
the URL <code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/forward&gt;</code> in
combination with the user's username/password. When using web-keys, such a
permission is solely identified by a web-key like:
<code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/#mhbqcmmva5ja3&gt;</code>. Where
previously the attacker could produce an HTML form whose action attribute
specified the required URL, now the attacker is unable to do so. Since the
attacker does not have permission to access the target resource, he does not
possess the user's web-key and so cannot produce an HTML form that generates a
request to the target resource.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_open" href="#cap_open">Does not depend on Same Origin Policy</a></h3>
<p>Notice that the XSRF defense mounted by a web-key does not depend upon
enforcement of the Same Origin Policy. In the discussed popular defense to
XSRF, a GET request to
<code>&lt;https://mail.example.com/user123/forward&gt;</code> produced the
secret to be added to the POST request. Consequently, an attacker's web page
must be prohibited from reading the response to such a GET request, a
restriction which is enforced by the Same Origin Policy. In the web-key
solution, there is no resource identified by a well-known URL that will produce
the corresponding web-key for a protected permission. Consequently, there is no
need to prevent an attacker's web page, or anyone else's, from reading the
response to a GET request it has issued.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been proposals for APIs that relax the Same Origin
Policy enforcement in the web browser

[<a href="#JSONRequest">JSONRequest</a>]. The web-key continues to provide an
effective solution to the XSRF attack, and other access control challenges, in
this more open environment. Should these proposals be widely adopted, a new Web
where any party really can share information with any other party will be
possible, using web-keys for access control. In the meantime, the web-key
provides more flexible access control for web agents not confined by the Same
Origin Policy, such as the server-side code of a mashup application.</p>
<h3><a name="cap_grain" href="#cap_grain">Fine-grained access control</a></h3>
<p>In a web-key application, each distinct permission is assigned a distinct
web-key. Consequently, authority over a restricted set of resources in a
web-application can be readily delegated to another web agent, such as a
mashup. The web-mail mashup discussed in the introduction to this paper can be
enabled by having the user pass the web-key for an email folder to the mashup
application. The mashup application can then create a presentation that merges
this email information with information from other sources, but is unable to
abuse other permissions in the web-mail application, such as permission to send
email as the user. Similarly, management of the previously discussed contact
information resource can be delegated to the corresponding friend, simply by
sending that friend a web-key for the contact resource.</p>
<h2><a name="rebuttal" href="#rebuttal">WHAT, ME WORRY?</a><sup><a href="#f8">8</a></sup></h2>
<p>This section examines the convention, and decrees, against including private
data in a URI. Some confusion is cleared up and some important safety tips are
discussed.</p>
<h3><a name="rebut_webarch" href="#rebut_webarch">Web-arch on access control</a></h3>
<p>The W3C's [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>], which is frequently cited by
this paper, also includes a short section on "Linking and access control". This
section does not declare any principles, constraints, or good practice notes.
The purpose of the section is further obscured by the conflation of two issues:
deep linking to publicly accessible resources and access control over private
resources. The text seems to be mostly motivated by the deep linking issue,
where the W3C's position is that a web site should use technology, rather than
public policy, to express constraints on deep links. Unfortunately, this
position is expressed using an analogy to access control measures in the
physical world:</p>
<blockquote>
"The owners of a building might have a policy that the public may only enter
the building via the main front door, and only during business hours. People
who work in the building and who make deliveries to it might use other doors as
appropriate. Such a policy would be enforced by a combination of security
personnel and mechanical devices such as locks and pass-cards. One would not
enforce this policy by hiding some of the building entrances, nor by requesting
legislation requiring the use of the front door and forbidding anyone to reveal
the fact that there are other doors to the building."
</blockquote>
<p>The analogy seems to be that a web-application is like a physical building
and that a door is like a URI. In this analogy, the deep linking issue is about
controlling which of multiple public entrances a member of the public uses,
since the URI in question leads to a publicly accessible resource. This
constraint is distinct from one which prevents unauthorized use of a private
resource, one which has not been made accessible to the public. The analogy
conflates the two, ending with a statement about the futility of attempting to
control the dissemination of publicly known information. But a URI providing
access to a private resource need not be publicly known and restricting
knowledge of it may be practical, whereas restricting knowledge of the doors to
a physical building is impractical.</p>
<p>The laws of physics for a web-application are much different than the laws
of physics for a brick-and-mortar building. It's feasible for a would-be
intruder to walk around a physical building to discover all the doors. As
discussed in section 3.1, it's cheap to construct a URI namespace that an
intruder cannot feasibly enumerate, nor even discover a single member of. In
the physical world, it's feasible for an intruder to discover a way into a
building by watching as authorized users enter. On the Internet, invisibility
cloaks are cheap and widely available. Using SSL, an authorized user can
interact with a web-application without being observed by others on the
network. While hiding may seem tricky or impractical for a physical object,
it's down to a science for bit strings. Using encryption, the contents of a
communication are hidden by controlling distribution of a corresponding
decryption key. Access to a private web resource can similarly be restricted by
controlling distribution of a corresponding web-key. An SSL session provides a
safe communications channel over which to exchange such secrets.</p>
<p>The web-arch document also expresses a concern that everyone be able to
refer to a resource, even if they are unable to access it. Reifying access to a
resource as a web-key does not preclude use of a separate well-known URI to
identify the resource itself. Such a well-known URI may well be part of the
representation produced when a web-key is dereferenced. Permission to access a
resource is distinct from the resource itself, so identifying these distinct
things by distinct URIs is in keeping with the principles, constraints and good
practice of Web architecture.</p>
<h3><a name="rebut_rfc3986" href="#rebut_rfc3986">RFCs 2616, 3986 on sensitive information</a></h3>
<p>Both RFC 2616 on HTTP/1.1 [<a href="#HTTP">HTTP</a>] and RFC 3986 on the URI
[<a href="#URI">URI</a>] provide security guidance advising against the
inclusion of sensitive information in a URI. The text from Section 7.5 of RFC
3986 provides a good summary of the arguments presented:</p>
<blockquote>
"URI producers should not provide a URI that contains a username or password
that is intended to be secret.  URIs are frequently displayed by browsers,
stored in clear text bookmarks, and logged by user agent history and
intermediary applications (proxies)."
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="proxies" href="#proxies">Proxies</a></h3>
<p>A web-key is a convention for construction of an https URL. When
dereferencing such a URL, the HTTP protocol is run over an SSL connection that
tunnels through proxies. The proxy server sees only the encrypted SSL data and
not the HTTP requests, nor any contained web-keys.</p>
<h3><a name="server_logs" href="#server_logs">Server logs</a></h3>
<p>When deploying a web-application that uses web-keys, it is expected that the
developer will have the ability to choose, or appropriately configure, the
server. Configuring the server to not make logs available to unauthorized third
parties is an important step to take. The web-key https URL convention
presented in this paper also makes it easy to write a program that sanitizes a
server log of any contained keys.</p>
<h3><a name="username-password" href="#username-password">Inclusion of a username/password</a></h3>
<p>Inclusion of a username/password in a URL is not safe and is not what a
web-key does. A username/password provides authority over an entire user
account; whereas a web-key only provides permission to access the identified
resource. For example, in a web-mail application a particular web-key may
provide read permission on a specific email. Passing this web-key to another
user only grants the recipient read permission on the specified email. In a
non-web-key design, a URL identifying a specific email but also containing the
user's password, provides the recipient full authority over the web-mail
account. This excess grant of authority may be very surprising for the user,
and so lead to unanticipated and detrimental consequences.</p>
<h3><a name="shoulder_surfing" href="#shoulder_surfing">Shoulder surfing</a></h3>
<p>When directly viewing a page identified by a web-key in a stock browser, the
key may be displayed in the browser's address bar. Many stock browsers can be
easily configured to not show the address bar; however, in many situations,
this precaution is unnecessary. When manipulating private web resources, the
user is frequently in a setting where shoulder surfing is not a concern. For
example, the user may be at home, in a private office or cube, or using a small
handheld device whose display is not easily seen by onlookers.</p>
<p>The web-application developer can also take measures to prevent shoulder
surfing. The top level page for a web-application may be identified by a URL
containing no sensitive information. This page first puts the user through a
traditional login ceremony using a password. A successful login yields the
user's web-keys, which are manipulated by code running inside the top level
page. From the web browser's perspective, the web-application consists of a
single page, identified by an innocuous URL, similar to many Web 2.0
applications.</p>
<h3><a name="browser_cache" href="#browser_cache">Browser cache</a></h3>
<p>Even before web-keys, the browser's cache contained much sensitive
information. Protecting this sensitive information has long received some
attention and is recently receiving more. For example, Internet Explorer has
long supported the option: "Do not save encrypted pages to disk". Many browsers
now support an option to empty the cache when the browser is closed.
Independent of web-keys, measures such as these to protect the browser cache
are important. These measures are also sufficient for protection of web-keys in
the browser cache.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmarks" href="#bookmarks">Clear text bookmarks</a></h3>
<p>The web-key is specifically designed to support bookmarking. Bookmarks are
part of the user interface that has made the publicly accessible Web usable,
and are needed to bring the same usability to private Web resources. Doing so
does mean that more care should be taken in storing a bookmarks file.
Mainstream operating systems provide options to mark a particular file, or even
an entire user directory, or file system, as one which should be stored
encrypted on disk. Browser implementers and users should avail themselves of
these features.</p>
<p>Without any configuration, many users' bookmarks also acquire a level of
protection by virtue of the fact that their computer is personal and so not
shared with others, against whose prying eyes encryption must be used.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The misconception that client authentication provides access control, and
the widespread use of this technique on the Web, is the cause of many of the
problems with today's Web. Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) bugs are a direct
expression of this misconception. Pervasive password prompts are part of the
implementation of a technique that does not actually provide the required
functionality. This user interaction conditions users to be easier prey for
phishing attacks. The requirement that proof of knowledge of a user password
accompany every request to a private resource undermines core architectural
principles of the Web: a URI alone is insufficient to direct a web agent to a
private resource; and resource identification and representation are no longer
orthogonal, since permission information must be accommodated for by the
representation format. The Same Origin Policy severely limits communication
between all sites, in an insufficient attempt to protect those sites suffering
from this misconception.</p>
<p>The web-key is an https URL convention for implementing transferable
permission on the Web. This convention enables solution of access control
challenges within the architectural model provided by the URI, thus enabling
non-public resources to also benefit from the advantages coming from the
principles identified by the W3C in "Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume
One" [<a href="#webarch">webarch</a>]. This compatibility also means that the
web-key technique can be applied using existing web development tools to create
web applications deployed to existing web browsers. The user interaction for a
web-key is the same as for other URLs; in particular, no user prompting is
required, such as is required with passwords. As new technology which relaxes
the Same Origin Policy is deployed, the web-key technique can be used to
implement access control in a Web free from communication restrictions.</p>

makes the HTTP protocol like a dynamically scoped language, where the callee
gets access to the caller's scope, rather than like a lexically scoped language
which implements an encapsulation boundary between callee and caller. In the
