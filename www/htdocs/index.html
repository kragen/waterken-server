  <h1>Waterken<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Server</h1>
  <p>Asynchronous invocation between event loops is a great model for building distributed applications. The Waterken
  Server provides a platform for building such applications in Java and making them accessible to HTTP-based clients.</p>
  <p>Server-side Java code is written to the <a href="javadoc/overview-summary.html">ref_send API</a>, which defines the
  asynchronous invocation interface. The Waterken Server implementation of the ref_send API provides orthogonal
  persistence and across-the-network transport of asynchronous invocations. Each invocation is sent as an HTTP request:
  either a <code>POST</code> for an update, or a <code>GET</code> for a query. The request URL fully identifies the
  invocation target and any arguments are carried in the request body, encoded in <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>. A
  JavaScript implementation of the ref_send API facilitates interaction with server-side objects from within the browser.
  For an example interaction, see the <a href="bang/">Bang Tutorial</a>. </p>
  <p>
  The Waterken Server supports use of capability-based security to control the actions of both server-side objects and
  remote clients. The ref_send API is designed for use by code that passes the <a href="http://joe-e.org/">Joe-E</a>
  verifier. Using this verifier, capability-based auditing techniques can be applied to bound the possible effects that
  can be caused by a server-side object. The Waterken Server implementation itself also passes the Joe-E verifier.
  A remote client can only access a server-side object via a cryptographically protected capability URL, called a
  web-key. By reasoning about what web-keys a remote client may come to possess, the possible effects on server-side
  objects can be bounded. Though the Waterken Server is designed for use with the Joe-E verifier, it can still be used
  with code that does not pass the verifier.</p>
