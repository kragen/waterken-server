<p>Any application that keeps state needs a plan for maintaining it as the
application evolves. Successfully managing these upgrades is one of the more
challenging aspects of application development. This document explains several
patterns and techniques for managing upgrade in a Waterken application.</p>
<h2><a name="engine" href="#engine">Persistence engine</a></h2>
<p>Application objects hosted by the Waterken server can exploit the provided
orthogonal persistence. At the end of every event loop turn, before any
externally visible I/O is done, the Waterken server persists all application
objects that are reachable from previously persisted objects.  This graph of
persistent objects is rooted in objects bound to an exported web-key. The
programmer expresses different strategies for persistent state through patterns
of extending, modifying and using this persistent object graph. This paper
presents these patterns and shows how they can be expressed using the
<a href="../javadoc/overview-summary.html">ref_send API</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="ephemeral" href="#ephemeral">Ephemeral pleasures</a></h2>
<p>An effective strategy for dealing with the challenges of persistent state is
avoiding it. When using the Waterken server, there are several ways in which
persistence can be usefully avoided.</p>
<p>Any created Java object that is not referenced by a previously persisted Java
object at the end of an event loop turn is not persisted. Since the object is
never stored, the programmer is freed from the burden of planning for its
upgrade.</p>
<p>The GUI for a Waterken application is often a web-application.  The state of
this GUI is rebuilt anew on each visit to the application, using state pulled
into the browser via web-keys. It's a good strategy to express as much of the
application logic as possible in the ephemeral web-application, rather than in
persistent Java objects. Think of the state maintained by the Waterken server as
the application's model, as in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Your
application's view and controller are then implemented in the ephemeral
web-application. This design reduces the upgrade challenge to the design of the
application's model. Constraining the scope of the upgrade challenge in this way
is the most important step to take in the design of an application's persistence
strategy.</p>
<h2><a name="minor" href="#minor">Minor surgery</a></h2>
<p>As an application evolves, its model may need to be extended. Objects are
persisted by the Waterken server using Java Object Serialization, which supports
a useful set of
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/version.html#6754">compatible upgrades</a>,
such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>adding and removing methods</li>
<li>adding and removing interfaces</li>
<li>adding and removing classes in the inheritance chain</li>
<li>adding and removing fields</li>
<li>changing the declared type of a non-primitive field</li>
</ul>
<p>When upgrading an object requires an algorithmic step, a class can declare a
<code>readObject</code> method of the form:
</p>
<pre>
private void
readObject(final ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException,
                                              ClassNotFoundException {
    // read in the old state
    in.defaultReadObject();

    // using the old state, upgrade the object to the new format
    &hellip;
}
</pre>
<p>Java Object Serialization only allows these upgrades if the serialized class
declares them to be allowed. This is done by declaring a
<code>serialVersionUID</code> field, such as:
</p>
<pre>
    static private final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
</pre>
<p>This field should be declared as part of the first steps in creating a
persistent class.</p>
<h3><a name="touch" href="#touch">Pushing all state through a minor upgrade</a></h3>
<p>Once the desired changes have been made to a set of upgraded classes, the
upgrade can be applied using the <kbd>touch.jar</kbd> command provided by the
Waterken server. For example, to upgrade a vat named <code>test</code>, as well
as all of its child vats:</p>
<ol>
<li>stop the Waterken server</li>
<li>replace the old class files with the upgraded ones</li>
<li>from the home folder of the Waterken installation, run the command:
    <p><kbd>java -jar touch.jar vat/test</kbd></p></li>
<li>restart the Waterken server</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="amputation" href="#amputation">Amputation</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, it's not feasible to express an algorithm for upgrading old state
using the techniques described in the previous section. In this case, it's also
sometimes the case that the old state is no longer needed in the upgraded
application. In this situation, a viable upgrade strategy is to simply plan to
abandon some objects. When the Waterken server is deserializing part of an
object graph, it doesn't immediately follow an eventual reference, but instead
delays loading of this part of the graph until the target object is accessed by
the application. To plan for amputation of part of an application's persistent
object graph, only refer to objects in that part of the graph using eventual
references. Once bit rot takes hold in that part of the object graph, change the
application code to no longer access it. If the stale objects are no longer
accessed, they will never be loaded and so will never produce any incompatible
serialization errors.</p>
<h3><a name="commuter" href="#commuter">Commuter pattern</a></h3>
<p>To support delayed loading of part of an object graph, and so enable
amputation of it, a class must use an eventual reference to refer to an object
that instances may need immediate access to. To facilitate this pattern, the
ref_send API provides some syntactic sugar:</p>
<pre>
import static org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual.<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/promise/eventual/Eventual.html#near(T)">near</a>;
&hellip;

public final class
Stable implements Serializable {
    static private final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private final Eventual _;
    private       Unstable dependency_;

    &hellip;

    public void
    setDependency(final Unstable dependency) {
        dependency_ = _._(dependency);
    }

    public void
    doSomething() {
        final Unstable dependency = <span class="highlight">near</span>(dependency_);
        final String foo = dependency.getFoo();
        &hellip;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>If the type <code>Unstable</code> in the example above is a class, rather
than an interface, implementation of the pattern is slightly different:</p>
<pre>
import static org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled.<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/promise/Fulfilled.html#detach(T)">detach</a>;
import static org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual.<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/promise/eventual/Eventual.html#near(org.ref_send.promise.Volatile)">near</a>;
&hellip;

public final class
Stable implements Serializable {
    static private final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private final Eventual _;
    <span class="highlight">private       Promise&lt;Unstable&gt; dependency_;</span>

    &hellip;

    public void
    setDependency(final Unstable dependency) {
        <span class="highlight">dependency_ = detach(dependency);</span>
    }

    public void
    doSomething() {
        final Unstable dependency = near(dependency_);
        final String foo = dependency.getFoo();
        &hellip;
    }
}
</pre>
<h2><a name="implants" href="#implants">Implants</a></h2>
<p>There are two major roles for an application's model: storing information and
enforcing the rules that govern changes and access to this information. Evolving
an application sometimes means supporting new ways of manipulating the same
underlying information. To support this kind of upgrade, an application's model
should segregate objects that hold the application's state from objects that
define the application's behaviour.  The goal of this segregation is to enable
creation of a new layer of behaviour objects for the same set of state
objects.</p>
<p>For example, the
<code><a href="https://y-hzpaiycw7dur5zcyena5qzq.yurl.net/">yurl.net</a></code>
DNS nameserver is a Waterken server application for managing DNS records. When
the <kbd><a href="../deploy/#genkey">genkey.jar</a></kbd> command is run, a new
vat is created to manage the DNS resources for a newly created hostname. The
application model stored in this vat segregates application state, the held DNS
resources, from application behaviour, editing of those resources, and provides
a hook for the introduction of new behaviour.</p>
<p>The nameserver's application state is held in an array of
<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/var/Variable.html">variables</a>, each of which
holds an arbitrary
<code><a href="http://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/waterken/server/trunk/waterken/dns/src/org/waterken/dns/Resource.java?view=markup#l_14">Resource</a></code>.
</p>
<p>The nameserver's behaviour is defined by the
<code><a href="http://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/waterken/server/trunk/waterken/dns/src/org/waterken/dns/editor/ResourceGuard.java?view=markup#l_10">ResourceGuard</a></code>,
which constrains the supported DNS resource types, and the
<code><a href="http://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/waterken/server/trunk/waterken/shared/src/org/waterken/menu/MenuMaker.java?view=markup#l_26">Menu</a></code>,
which supports editing of the variable array.</p>
<p>On creation, a
<code><a href="http://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/waterken/server/trunk/waterken/dns/src/org/waterken/dns/editor/DomainMaster.java?view=markup#l_15">DomainMaster</a></code>
object provides the client access to objects that define the application's
current behaviour, as well as an object that may define future application
behaviour. The <code>extension</code> member of <code>DomainMaster</code> refers
to an object that holds references to all of the objects embodying the
application's state. This extension object provides a hook for introducing new
behaviour for the existing application state. The hook is used by adding a new
method to the extension object that creates a new layer of behaviour
objects.</p>
<h2><a name="offload" href="#offload">Offload</a></h2>
<p>If plans for upgrade don't work out, or the cumulative complexity from
multiple upgrades becomes too much, it may be best to start over with a new
design, bootstrapping new vats with application data pulled in from the old
model. To enable this offloading of application state, the application model
should support a query interface that can generate
<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/package-summary.html#package_description">documents</a>
describing the current application state.</p>
<p>For example, the previously discussed DNS nameserver supports creation of
such application state documents via the Menu's
<code><a href="http://waterken.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/waterken/server/trunk/waterken/shared/src/org/waterken/menu/MenuMaker.java?view=markup#l_39">getSnapshot</a>()</code>
method. This method returns a document describing all of the current DNS
resources for a hostname.</p>
<h2><a name="philosophy" href="#philosophy">Application design philosophy</a></h2>
<p>In addition to its role in persistence, the vat is also the unit of
concurrency. Each vat is serviced by its own thread, so
<a href="../javadoc/org/web_send/graph/Spawn.html#run(java.lang.Class)">spawning</a>
a new vat creates a new thread, enabling concurrent execution within an
application. To exploit multiple processor cores, an application should be
designed to use many vats.</p>
<p>Once an object is persisted, its state remains on disk until the hosting vat
is <a href="../javadoc/org/web_send/graph/Framework.html#destruct">destructed</a>.
If the object is not in use, it will never be loaded and so won't consume the
computer's processing power or memory, but will consume filesystem space. To
reclaim this space, an application should be designed around short-lived vats
that are periodically destructed, giving way to new vats. Whenever an
application is about to engage in an activity that will generate a bunch of new
persistent objects, a new vat should be spawned for that activity. When the
activity completes, the spawned vat should be destructed, after producing a
<a href="../javadoc/org/ref_send/package-summary.html#package_description">document</a>
describing the outcome of the activity.</p>
<p>To best leverage the platform provided by the Waterken server, applications
should be designed around a vat usage philosophy of: "Live fast, die young and
leave a good-looking corpse". Spawn vats frequently to make an application
faster by exploiting concurrency. Destruct vats soon to avoid the upgrade
problems that come with long-lived state and to reclaim filesystem space.
Produce state description documents to facilitate upgrade and interoperation
with other applications.</p>
