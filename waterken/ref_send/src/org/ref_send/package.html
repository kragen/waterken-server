A pass-by-construction interface.
<p>
The ref_send API supports the design of interfaces that work well in a
distributed application. One of the differences between a local application and
a distributed application is the importance of pass-by-copy data. In a local
application, the difference between accessing a variable versus calling a method
may be negligible. In a distributed application, the difference may be
significant since an additional network request may be required for the method
invocation.  This network request negatively impacts performance since an
additional network round-trip is required. More importantly though, the
additional network request complicates the client code since it must now cope
with the timing issues and failure modes that come with doing a network request.
Client code is often much simpler when all the data it needs can be provided as
one bundle. To support creating such data bundles, this package defines an API
for declaring a pass-by-construction class. When an object of such a class is
sent in a method invocation, or return, its publicly accessible state is sent,
instead of a remote reference. Similarly, such an object can be reconstructed
when its state is received as part of a method invocation.
</p>
<p>
A class can be made pass-by-construction simply by declaring it to be so and
annotating one of its public constructors with information mapping the class'
public fields to its constructor parameters. For example:
</p>
<pre>
package org.example.membership;

import org.joe_e.{@link org.joe_e.Struct};
import org.ref_send.{@link org.ref_send.deserializer};
import org.ref_send.{@link org.ref_send.name};
import org.ref_send.{@link org.ref_send.Record};

import java.io.{@link java.io.Serializable};

/**
 * Information about a club member.
 */
public class
LoyaltyCard extends Struct implements Record, Serializable {
    static private final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * member's full name
     */
    public final String name;

    /**
     * year membership began
     */
    public final int year;

    /**
     * Is a premium member?
     */
    public final boolean premium;

    /**
     * Constructs an instance.
     * &#64;param name    {&#64;link #name}
     * &#64;param year    {&#64;link #year}
     * &#64;param premium {&#64;link #premium}
     */
    public &#64;deserializer
    LoyaltyCard(&#64;name("name") final String name,
                &#64;name("year") final int year,
                &#64;name("premium") final boolean premium) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
        this.premium = premium;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The Javadoc comments in the above example are purely optional. The important
steps are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>implement {@link org.ref_send.Record}</li>
 <li>implement {@link java.io.Serializable} and declare a
     <code>serialVersionUID</code></li>
 <li>declare each piece of data to be sent as a <code>public final</code>
     field</li>
 <li>annotate one public constructor with the {@link org.ref_send.deserializer}
     annotation</li>
 <li>annotate each parameter in the deserialization constructor with the
     {@linkplain org.ref_send.name} of the corresponding public field</li>
 <li>implement the deserialization constructor as a simple assignment of
     arguments to member fields</li>
 <li>extend the {@link org.joe_e.Struct} class, which provides default
     implementations for the {@link java.lang.Object}
     {@link java.lang.Object#equals equals()} and
     {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode hashCode()} methods that do a by-value
     comparision, instead of using the object's creation identity</li>
</ul>
<p>
When using the Waterken Server, a remote invocation whose sole argument is an
instance of the class above results in an HTTP request with the following
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> data:
</p>
<pre>
[ {
  "$": [ "org.example.membership.LoyaltyCard" ],
  "name": "Tyler Close",
  "year": 2008,
  "premium": true
  } ]
</pre>
<p>
The networking code in the Waterken Server automatically recognizes which
invocation arguments are {@link org.ref_send.Record} objects and produces the
corresponding JSON data for them.  You can create an arbitrarily large JSON
document by constructing an arbitrarily deep tree of {@link org.ref_send.Record}
objects. For example, the class below adds an address and
{@linkplain org.joe_e.array array} of tags:
</p>
<pre>
package org.example.membership;

import org.joe_e.array.{@link org.joe_e.array.PowerlessArray};
import org.ref_send.{@link org.ref_send.deserializer};
import org.ref_send.{@link org.ref_send.name};

/**
 * Postal information about a club member.
 */
public class
MailingLoyaltyCard extends LoyaltyCard {
    static private final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * postal address
     */
    public final Address address;

    /**
     * a list of tags indicating mailing preferences
     */
    public final PowerlessArray&lt;String&gt; preferences;

    /**
     * Constructs an instance.
     * &#64;param name        {&#64;link #name}
     * &#64;param year        {&#64;link #year}
     * &#64;param premium     {&#64;link #premium}
     * &#64;param address     {&#64;link #address}
     * &#64;param preferences {&#64;link #preferences}
     */
    public &#64;deserializer
    MailingLoyaltyCard(
          &#64;name("name") final String name,
          &#64;name("year") final int year,
          &#64;name("premium") final boolean premium,
          &#64;name("address") final Address address,
          &#64;name("preferences") final PowerlessArray&lt;String&gt; preferences) {
        super(name, year, premium);
        this.address = address;
        this.preferences = preferences;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
An instance of the above class would produce JSON like:
</p>
<pre>
[ {
  "$": [ "org.example.membership.MailingLoyaltyCard", "org.example.membership.LoyaltyCard" ],
  "name": "Tyler Close",
  "year": 2008,
  "premium": true,
  "address": {
    "street": "1501 Page Mill Road",
    "city": "Palo Alto",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "94304"
    },
  "preferences": [ "2-day-shipping", "monthly" ]
  } ]
</pre>
<p>
By making effective use of {@link org.ref_send.Record} objects, you can create
distributed applications in the document-oriented messaging style. In such
applications, clients and servers coordinate primarily based on the content of
exchanged documents, rather than on expectations about remotely maintained
state. Such designs can sometimes result in fewer dependencies between clients
and servers and so facilitate the creation of interoperable software. When using
the ref_send API, you define the structure of your exchanged documents by
defining a set of {@link org.ref_send.Record} types. Each exchanged document is
then created by composing an object tree from these {@link org.ref_send.Record}
types.
